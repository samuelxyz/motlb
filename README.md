# March of the Little Boxes
## A 2D battlefield strategy game

Basically I'm learning C++ by coding a game. This game was originally my final project for AP Computer Science in high school, and I wrote the first version in Java.

## Original description:

This is a game about little boxes, "units," that fight each other in teams.

The battle will be on your right, while your control panel is on the left.
Select a unit type in your control panel, and click somewhere on the
battle to place it there. (You can do this at any time.)
Or use the line tool! You'll have to figure it out.

Each unit type behaves differently. It's your job to study them and learn
how best to use them. Investigate the controls, too.

In campaign mode, you play as Blue Team with limited resources.
Or, in sandbox mode, make as much carnage as you want!

The world is yours to conquer. Good luck, and have fun!
